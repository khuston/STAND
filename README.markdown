# Bayesian Python implementation of STAND

Kyle Huston, 11 May 2016

This directory contains a Jupyter notebook with an implementation of the STAND model by [Garrido, Brocos, Amigo, García-Río, Gracia-Fadrique, and Piñeiro (2016)](http://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b00477). I have checked it against the results of the official STAND implementation using the example on that website, but I cannot guarantee the accuracy of this implenentation.
